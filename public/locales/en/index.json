You can use this feature to express your interest and communicate directly with the artist. Typically, artists respond to inquiries within 1-3 days, commencing a dialogue where you can discuss the details of your potential purchase, including the finalizing of the deal and arranging any shipping or collection logistics. It's important to note that Artportable acts as a facilitator in these transactions and does not charge a commission on sold works. Even if you're not a registered member, you're still able to reach out to the artist. However, we ask that you respect the artists' time and only contact them if you're a potential buyer or have legitimate queries related to their work. Breaches of this guideline will be duly reported. We encourage art buyers and art lovers alike to create a free account with Artportable.
