  "readDescription": "There is no universal definition of art. However, most people seem to agree that art is the deliberate creation of something beautiful or meaningful using skill and imagination. The definition of art has been debated for centuries. What really is art seems to be a question for every culture and every new generation of people. For a long time, a work of art was valued based on how faithfully it replicated its subject. This definition of ”good art” has not least given status to the so-called ”great masters”. In later centuries, the emotions that art conveys - in the sublime or dramatic painting or in the reflection of the new, modern society - gained high status. Not least, the audience is an important part of the art and is often expected to express some kind of response or even communicate directly with the creator behind the work.",
